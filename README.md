# QR_Code_Scanner
I have made this QR Code generator to generate the QR code for your required things like:-
By scanning your QR code users can be redirected to your website, app or anything/anywhere you want.

To make this, first, you should download some python modules from pypi.org.
Modules required to make this little project are pyqrcode, pypng, pyzbar.

How to download modules?

Open your CMD with administrator privilege and type pip install moduleName.
After Downloading all the required modules just import them in your IDE.

Thats It.
